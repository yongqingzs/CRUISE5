* Release 3.0  2 Nov 2023  in VS C++ 2022  

* If you have Visual Studio 2022 installed, just click on file CRUISE5.sln, compile and run.
  You will be running the input.asc file. To run the other input files you have to first copy 
  them to input.asc.

* If you use older MS Visual C++ compiler versions, you have to build the Project/Solution
  in that environment

* To get access to the plotting and analysis programs of CADAC Studio, go to 
			https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/book/10.2514/4.102509 -> Supplemental Material
  CADAC Studio is compatible with all MS Windows ORs

* An alternate plotting option is provided by creating CSV (comma separated variables) formatted plot files.
  -> At the OPTION line in 'input.asc' insert 'y_csv'. The plot.asc and traj.asc files will be written in CSV
	  format, which is compatible with Excel, MATLAB, SCILAB, and several other plotting programs.
